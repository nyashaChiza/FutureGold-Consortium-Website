         <h2>Risk and Disclosure Terms</h2> 
         <p>
Foreign Exchange Trading on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in Foreign Exchange, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite.</p><p>
The possibility exists that you could sustain a lost of some or all your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with all exchange currency trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. If you don’t understand any of the information provided on this page, please contact us or seek advice from an independent financial advisor.</p><p>
Trading performance displayed herein is hypothetical. Hypothetical performance results may have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown, in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual result subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance trading results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect trading results.</p><p>
Commodity futures trading commission futures and options trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the Futures and Options markets. Don’t trade with money you cannot afford to lose. This is neither a solicitation nor an offer to bull/sell futures or options. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses, similar to those discussed on this website. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is not necessarily indicative of future results. Trade at your own risk. </p><p>
The information provided here is of the nurture of a general comment only and neither purports nor intents to be, specific trading advice. It has been prepared without any regard to any particular person’s investment objectives, financial situation and particular needs. Information should not be considered as an offer or enticement to buy, sell or Trade.</p><p>
You should seek appropriate advice from your broker, or licenced investment advisor, before taking any action. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Simulated performance results contain inherent limitations. Unlike actual performance records, the results may under or over compensate for such factors such as lack of liquidity. No presentation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses to those shown. The risk of loss in trading can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. If you purchase or sell equities, futures, currencies or options you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain your position. If the markets move against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the prescribed time, you position may be liquidated on a loss, and you may be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.</p><p>
Under certain market condition, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market makes a “limit move”. The placement of contingent orders by you, such as “stoploss” or Stop limit” order, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since the market conditions could make it impossible to execute such orders. By viewing any FutureGold Consortium text, audio, visual commentary, video or presentation, you acknowledge and accept that all trading decisions are your own sore responsibility and the author, FutureGold Consortium and anybody associated with FutureGold Consortium cannot be held responsible for any losses that are incurred as a result.</p><p>
